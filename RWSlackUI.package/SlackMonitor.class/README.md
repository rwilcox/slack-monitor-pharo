SlackMonitor - watch all your Slack channels in one window. (A real time All Unread feed).

TODO:
   * Declare dependency
  * Add to World Menu
  * Publish to smalltalkhub ?
  * Better class documentation
  * Real OAuth flow

Please comment me using the following template inspired by Class Responsibility Collaborator (CRC) design:

For the Class part:  State a one line summary. For example, "I represent a paragraph of text".

For the Responsibility part: Three sentences about my main responsibilities - what I do, what I know.

For the Collaborators Part: State my main collaborators and one line about how I interact with them.
